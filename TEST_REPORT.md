## ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Required

### 1. Anthropic API Key (Chat Functionality)

**Status:** ‚ùå Not Configured  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Chat endpoint returns "Internal server error"

#### Current State:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

#### Required Action:
1. Get API key from https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Update `.env` file:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your_actual_key_here
   ```
3. Restart server

#### Test Command:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"What is Dark Sun?"}'
```

**Expected Result:** Should return Claude's response about Dark Sun setting

---

### 2. SSH Key Authentication (MCP Server Access)

**Status:** ‚ùå Not Configured  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Cannot connect to Foundry VTT MCP server via SSH

#### Current Behavior:
```
foundry@foundry.azthir-terra.com: Permission denied (publickey,password)
```

#### Required Action:

**On your local Mac** (where you normally access Foundry):

1. Check if you already have SSH access:
   ```bash
   ssh foundry@foundry.azthir-terra.com "echo success"
   ```

2. If you do, get your public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   # or
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

3. For the remote environment, you'll need to add SSH keys. This can be done by:
   - Using SSH agent forwarding when connecting to the remote environment
   - Or copying your SSH private key to the remote environment (less secure)
   - Or generating a new SSH key pair in the remote environment and adding it to the Foundry server

**Recommended approach:**
```bash
# On the remote environment
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "darksun-assistant"
# Then add the generated public key to foundry server's authorized_keys
```

#### Test Command:
```bash
ssh foundry@foundry.azthir-terra.com "echo 'Connection successful'"
```

**Expected Result:** Should print "Connection successful" without password prompt

---

### 3. Foundry MCP Bridge Module

**Status:** ‚ùå Not Installed  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Cannot query Foundry VTT data through MCP protocol

#### Current Behavior:
- Port 31415 (MCP Bridge) not responding
- This is the WebSocket port for the MCP Bridge module

#### Required Action:

**In your Foundry VTT instance:**

1. Log in to Foundry at https://foundry.azthir-terra.com:30000
2. Go to **Setup** ‚Üí **Add-on Modules**
3. Click **Install Module**
4. Use manifest URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/adambdooley/foundry-vtt-mcp/blob/master/packages/foundry-module/module.json
   ```
5. Install the module
6. Launch your Dark Sun world
7. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Manage Modules**
8. Enable "Foundry MCP Bridge"
9. Save and check Foundry console (F12) for:
   ```
   Foundry MCP Bridge: Server started on port 31415
   ```

#### Verification:
From the Foundry server itself, test the MCP Bridge:
```bash
ssh foundry@foundry.azthir-terra.com "curl -s localhost:31415"
```

**Expected Result:** Should return WebSocket upgrade response or MCP handshake

---

### 4. MCP Server Configuration (Local Paths)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Configured but Not Accessible  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Impact:** Cannot access Obsidian vault and campaign materials

#### Current Configuration:
```typescript
// In src/mcp-client.ts
{
  name: 'obsidian-vault',
  command: 'npx',
  args: [
    '-y',
    '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem',
    '/Users/christopherallbritton/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/Dark Sun Campaign'
  ]
},
{
  name: 'dark-sun-materials',
  command: 'npx',
  args: [
    '-y',
    '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem',
    '/Users/christopherallbritton/Documents/DnD.5e/06-Campaign-Resources/3. Dark Sun'
  ]
}
```

#### Issue:
These paths are on your **local Mac**, but the server is running in a **remote environment**. These will only work when running the server locally on your Mac.

#### Options:

**Option A: Run Server Locally (Recommended for Development)**
```bash
# On your Mac
cd ~/path/to/dark-sun-assistant
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

**Option B: Mount Remote Directories**
If you want to run the server remotely but access local files:
- Use `sshfs` to mount your Mac's directories on the remote server
- Update paths in `src/mcp-client.ts` to point to mounted directories

**Option C: Copy Files to Remote**
- Copy Obsidian vault and campaign materials to remote server
- Update paths in `src/mcp-client.ts`

## üîß How to Enable MCP Connections

Currently, MCP servers are in "mock mode" (configured but not connected). To enable real connections:

### Step 1: Update MCP Client Manager

Edit `src/mcp-client.ts` and modify the `initialize()` method:

```typescript
async initialize(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('MCP Client Manager initializing...');
  console.log('Configured servers:', this.configs.map(c => c.name));
  
  // Connect to each configured server
  for (const config of this.configs) {
    try {
      await this.connectToServer(config);
      console.log(`‚úì Connected to ${config.name}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`‚úó Failed to connect to ${config.name}:`, error);
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Rebuild and Restart
```bash
npm run rebuild
npm start
```

### Step 3: Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Look for `"status": "connected"` for successfully connected servers.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### For Testing Without Configuration:

The server is **fully functional** for testing the UI and basic API:

```bash
# Server is already running at:
http://localhost:3000

# Test the health endpoint:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Test conversations:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/conversations

# Visit the UI in a browser:
# (open http://localhost:3000)
```

### For Full Functionality:

1. **Add Anthropic API Key** (5 minutes)
   - Get key from https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Update `.env` file
   - Restart server

2. **Install Foundry MCP Bridge** (10 minutes)
   - Install module in Foundry VTT
   - Enable in your Dark Sun world
   - Verify port 31415 is listening

3. **Configure SSH Access** (15 minutes)
   - Set up SSH keys
   - Test connection
   - Update MCP client to use real connections

---

## üêõ Known Issues

### 1. In-Memory Storage
**Impact:** Data lost on server restart  
**Workaround:** None currently  
**Future:** Implement SQLite or PostgreSQL storage

### 2. No Authentication
**Impact:** Anyone with access can use the assistant  
**Workaround:** Use firewall rules or SSH tunnel  
**Future:** Add user authentication

### 3. Local File Paths in Config
**Impact:** MCP servers for Obsidian won't work in remote environment  
**Workaround:** Run server locally on Mac  
**Future:** Make paths configurable per environment

## üí° Tips for Your Local Mac Setup

Since you mentioned you're accessing Foundry from your local Mac, here's how to run everything locally:

```bash
# On your Mac (best for full functionality)
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/dark-sun-assistant  # or wherever you cloned it

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Add your API key to .env
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your_key_here" >> .env

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start

# Or use development mode for auto-reload:
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

**Benefits of running locally:**
- ‚úÖ Direct access to Obsidian vault
- ‚úÖ Direct access to campaign materials
- ‚úÖ Easier SSH key management
- ‚úÖ Better development experience
